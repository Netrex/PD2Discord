# PD2Discord

A simple executable that makes it possible to display ProjectDiablo2 as a playing game on discord. What it does is it launches PD2Launcher.exe while running as a separate app next to it on the taskbar. You can then add this program to Discord Registered Games and rename it to ProjectDiablo2. It will auto-close when you close the PD2Launcher. It won't show any info on where you are in the game, only that you are playing the game.

## Installation

Put PD2Discord.exe in your PD2 folder next to PD2Launcher.exe
